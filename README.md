# Mentor

As my final project for the BSSA I've created a Mentoring app. It's aim is to connect students and recent graduates with young proffesionals in the same workfield, whom have been succesfull for a couple of years.

It's build as a peer-to-peer platform, where a mentee can search for the type of mentor he likes and make a booking. During a meeting, the mentor can give advice on which skills to acquire, which companies to focus on and share relevant people within his network.

Deployment on Heroku coming up!
